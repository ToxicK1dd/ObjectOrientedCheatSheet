 - Controller

### Gang of Four 
The [Gang of Four](https://springframework.guru/gang-of-four-design-patterns/) (GoF) design patterns are a collection of 23 design patterns that provide solutions to common software design problems. 

These patterns were defined by Erich Gamma, Richard Helm, Ralph Johnson, and John Vlissides in their book "Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software". 
The GoF design patterns are divided into three categories:

 - Creational Design Patterns
   - Abstract Factory. Allows the creation of objects without specifying their concrete type.
   - Builder. Uses to create complex objects.
   - Factory Method. Creates objects without specifying the exact class to create.
   - Prototype. Creates a new object from an existing object.
   - Singleton. Ensures only one instance of an object is created.
 - Structural Design Patterns
   - Adapter. Allows for two incompatible classes to work together by wrapping an interface around one of the existing classes.
   - Bridge. Decouples an abstraction so two classes can vary independently.
   - Composite. Takes a group of objects into a single object.
   - Decorator. Allows for an object’s behavior to be extended dynamically at run time.
   - Facade. Provides a simple interface to a more complex underlying object.
   - Flyweight. Reduces the cost of complex object models.
   - Proxy. Provides a placeholder interface to an underlying object to control access, reduce cost, or reduce complexity.
 - Behavior Design Patterns
   - Chain of Responsibility. Delegates commands to a chain of processing objects.
   - Command. Creates objects which encapsulate actions and parameters.
   - Interpreter. Implements a specialized language.
   - Iterator. Accesses the elements of an object sequentially without exposing its underlying representation.
   - Mediator. Allows loose coupling between classes by being the only class that has detailed knowledge of their methods.
   - Memento. Provides the ability to restore an object to its previous state.
   - Observer. Is a publish/subscribe pattern which allows a number of observer objects to see an event.
   - State. Allows an object to alter its behavior when its internal state changes.
   - Strategy. Allows one of a family of algorithms to be selected on-the-fly at run-time.
   - Template Method. Defines the skeleton of an algorithm as an abstract class, allowing its sub-classes to provide concrete behavior.
   - Visitor. Separates an algorithm from an object structure by moving the hierarchy of methods into one object.

### Common Anti-Patterns and Code Smells

Anti-patterns and code smells are common issues found in software development that can lead to negative consequences,\
and hinder the quality and maintainability of a codebase.

Recognizing and addressing these anti-patterns, and code smells is crucial for building better software systems,\
and improving the overall quality of the codebase.


| Anti-Pattern / Code Smell   | Type         | Explanation |
|-----------------------------|--------------|-------------|
| Anemic Domain Model         | Anti-Pattern | Occurs when the domain objects lack behavior and are primarily used as data containers, resulting in business logic being spread across multiple classes. |
| Boat Anchor                 | Anti-Pattern | Describes a piece of code or functionality that is no longer needed or used but remains in the codebase, adding unnecessary complexity and maintenance overhead. |
| Code Duplication            | Code Smell   | The presence of redundant or repeated code blocks, indicating a need for refactoring to improve code maintainability and reduce the risk of inconsistencies. |
| Dead Code                   | Code Smell   | Refers to code that is no longer executed or reachable during program execution, usually due to refactoring, changes in requirements, or developer oversight. |
| Dead Comments               | Code Smell   | Inactive or obsolete comments that no longer provide relevant information or clarification, cluttering the codebase. |
| Feature Envy                | Code Smell   | Occurs when a class or method excessively relies on the data or behavior of another class, indicating a potential design flaw. |
| God Objects                 | Anti-Pattern | Represents a class or module that has excessive responsibilities and knows too much about other parts of the system, leading to low cohesion and difficult maintenance. |
| Golden Hammer               | Anti-Pattern | Refers to the tendency to overuse a familiar tool or technology, even when it is not the most suitable or effective solution for the given problem. |
| Inappropriate Intimacy      | Code Smell   | Describes a situation where two classes are tightly coupled and overly dependent on each other, leading to reduced maintainability and flexibility. |
| Inner-Platform Effect       | Anti-Pattern | Refers to the phenomenon where developers build custom abstractions or frameworks that replicate the functionality of existing mature platforms, leading to increased complexity and maintenance burden. |
| Large Class                 | Code Smell   | Indicates a class that has grown too large, potentially violating the Single Responsibility Principle and making the code harder to understand and maintain. |
| Magic Numbers/Strings       | Code Smell   | Refers to the usage of hard-coded numerical or string literals without proper explanation or abstraction, reducing code readability and maintainability. |
| Message Chains              | Code Smell   | Involves a series of method calls on different objects, indicating a potential violation of the Law of Demeter and increasing coupling between classes. |
| Middle Man                  | Anti-Pattern | Refers to a class that serves as an unnecessary intermediary between two components, adding unnecessary indirection and complexity to the codebase. |
| Primitive Obsession         | Code Smell   | Occurs when primitive data types are used excessively instead of creating proper abstractions or domain-specific classes, leading to less expressive code. |
| Shotgun Surgery             | Anti-Pattern | Occurs when a single change to the system requires making numerous small modifications across different classes or modules, resulting in fragile code. |
| Speculative Generality      | Anti-Pattern | Occurs when code is designed to be overly flexible or generic to accommodate potential future requirements that may never arise, resulting in unnecessary complexity. |
| Spaghetti Code              | Code Smell   | Describes code that is tangled and difficult to understand, typically due to excessive and uncontrolled branching, lack of proper structure, and poor naming. |

### Explanations

- **Anti-Patterns**: *Anti-patterns refer to common practices or solutions in software development that appear to be beneficial but ultimately lead to negative consequences. They are typically patterns of behavior, architecture, or design that are counterproductive and can hinder the development process, introduce complexity, reduce maintainability, or increase the likelihood of errors. Recognizing and avoiding anti-patterns helps developers build better software systems.*

- **Code Smells**: *Code smells are indicators or symptoms in code that suggest potential design or implementation issues. They are specific characteristics or patterns in the codebase that may not necessarily be incorrect but could indicate areas that could be improved for better maintainability, readability, or extensibility. Code smells are usually subjective and rely on experienced developers' judgment to identify potential problem areas and apply appropriate refactoring techniques.*

Both anti-patterns and code smells serve as warning signs that highlight areas in software development where improvements can be made. By understanding and addressing these issues, developers can strive for cleaner, more maintainable codebases and avoid common pitfalls in software development.

### Goals of Avoiding Code Smells and Anti-Patterns

The primary goals of identifying and addressing code smells and anti-patterns in software development are to improve the codebase's maintainability, understandability, and performance. By actively avoiding these issues, developers can achieve the following:

1. **Enhance Maintainability**: *Code smells and anti-patterns often indicate areas of the codebase that are difficult to maintain. By eliminating or refactoring these problematic patterns, developers can make the codebase more modular, organized, and easier to modify. This results in a codebase that can be more readily adapted to new requirements or changes without introducing bugs or unforeseen side effects.*

2. **Improve Understandability**: *Code that is clean, well-structured, and free from smells and anti-patterns is easier to understand. Clear and concise code allows developers to comprehend the functionality and purpose of different components, classes, and methods more easily. This improves collaboration among team members, reduces the time spent on deciphering complex logic, and promotes better communication within the development team.*

3. **Increase Development Speed**: *A codebase free from code smells and anti-patterns enables developers to work more efficiently. By avoiding redundant code, complex logic, and unnecessary abstractions, developers can spend less time troubleshooting and more time delivering new features and resolving customer issues. This leads to faster development cycles, quicker bug fixes, and improved overall productivity.*

4. **Enhance Performance**: *Code smells and anti-patterns can have a negative impact on the performance of the software. Redundant code, excessive resource consumption, and inefficient algorithms can lead to decreased execution speed and increased memory usage. By addressing these issues, developers can optimize the codebase, resulting in improved performance and a more responsive application.*

5. **Foster Scalability and Extensibility**: *A codebase free from code smells and anti-patterns is more scalable and extensible. Clean code makes it easier to add new features, modify existing functionalities, and integrate with other systems. It enables developers to build upon a solid foundation and maintain a flexible architecture that can evolve as the software requirements change over time.*

By striving to avoid code smells and anti-patterns, developers create a more maintainable, understandable, and performant codebase. This not only benefits the development team but also improves the overall quality of the software product, leading to higher customer satisfaction and long-term success.

### User Stories

User stories are an *essential* component of **agile development** practices, allowing teams to capture requirements from the perspective of end-users. They serve as concise descriptions of specific features or functionality that users desire. By following a predefined template, user stories provide a structured approach to communicate user needs effectively.

User stories follow a standard format that helps capture requirements in an agile development setting. The format is: "_As a [role]_, I want _[goal/desire]_ so that _[benefit/outcome]._". This format enables clear and concise communication of user needs.

**Example User Story**: "_As a customer_, I want a user-friendly checkout process with multiple payment options so that I can easily complete my purchase and have a seamless shopping experience._"

In this example, the user story represents the perspective of a customer. The *goal* or *desire* is to have a user-friendly checkout process with multiple payment options. The intended *benefit* or *outcome* is to enable customers to complete their purchase smoothly and enjoy a seamless shopping experience.

This format helps clearly identify the user *role*, the desired *goal* or *feature*, and the expected *benefit* or *outcome* for the user. It facilitates effective communication and aligns the development team's efforts with delivering value to the end-users.

User stories play a crucial role in ensuring that development efforts are focused on meeting user needs and delivering tangible benefits. They promote a shared understanding among stakeholders and development teams regarding the desired functionality. This shared understanding aids in planning, prioritization, and implementation activities, leading to the development of user-centered and valuable software solutions.

To define well-formed user stories, two common acronyms are often used:

- **INVEST**:
  - **Independent**: User stories should be self-contained and not dependent on other stories.
  - **Negotiable**: User stories should be open to discussion and refinement through collaboration.
  - **Valuable**: User stories should deliver value to the end-users or stakeholders.
  - **Estimable**: User stories should be understandable and allow for estimation of effort.
  - **Small**: User stories should be small enough to be completed within a single iteration.
  - **Testable**: User stories should be written in a way that allows for verification and testing.

- **SMART**:
  - **Specific**: User stories should be specific and well-defined.
  - **Measurable**: User stories should include clear criteria for measuring their completion.
  - **Achievable**: User stories should be realistic and achievable within the project constraints.
  - **Relevant**: User stories should align with the project goals and objectives.
  - **Time-boxed**: User stories should have a clear time constraint or deadline.

By following these guidelines, user stories can effectively capture and communicate the desired functionality, enabling development teams to deliver valuable and user-centered software solutions.

- **Pascal Casing**: *Capitalizes the first letter of each word in a compound word or phrase, without using underscores or spaces. Example: `MyVariableName`, `CalculateTotalAmount`.*
- **Camel Casing**: *Capitalizes the first letter of each word except the first one, with no spaces or underscores. Example: `myVariableName`, `calculateTotalAmount`.*
- **Snake Case**: *Uses lowercase letters and underscores between words. Example: `my_variable_name`, `calculate_total_amount`.*
- **Hungarian Notation**: *Prefixes variable names with a type indicator to denote the variable's data type. Example: `strFirstName` for a string variable or `bIsEnabled` for a boolean variable.*
- **Verb-Noun Naming**: *Use verbs to represent actions and nouns to represent entities or objects. This convention helps clarify the purpose and behavior of the elements. Example: `getUserInfo`, `calculateTotalPrice`.*
- **Domain-Specific Naming**: *Use names specific to the problem domain you are working in. This makes the code more expressive and understandable within the context of the application. Example: `orderTotal`, `customerAddress`.*
- **Singular vs. Plural**: *Choose between singular and plural forms based on the nature of the entity being represented. Use singular form for individual instances and plural form for collections. Example: `car`, `cars`.*
- **Boolean Prefixes**: *When naming boolean variables or properties, consider using prefixes like "is," "has," or "should" to indicate their boolean nature. Example: `isAvailable`, `shouldProcess`, `hasPermission`.*
- **Constants**: *Use uppercase letters and underscores to represent constants. This convention helps distinguish them from regular variables. Example: `MAX_VALUE`, `DEFAULT_TIMEOUT`.*
